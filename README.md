**Maven Startup Project For Selenium Test Automation**

> While working on a project for test automation, youâ€™d require all the Selenium dependencies associated with it. Usually these dependencies are downloaded and upgraded manually throughout the project lifecycle, but as the project gets bigger, managing dependencies can be quite challenging. This is why you need build automation tools such as Maven to handle them automatically.

> Maven can be more specifically defined as a software project management tool which uses the concepts of project object model (POM). It enables the user to create initial folder structure, perform compilation and testing and then package and deploy the final product. It efficiently cuts down several steps followed in the build process and rather makes the build a one step process.

In this repository has been Maven Startup Project For Selenium Test Automation.
